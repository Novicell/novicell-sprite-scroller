# ðŸ“¦ Novicell Packager

## Description
Novicell-packager helps to finalize your small javascript project/module. It's a boilerplate webpack setup that bundles, creates a **dist** folder with ready-to-distribute file.

## Setup

* Make sure you have node installed
* Clone this repo to inside your module
* Go to the novicell-packager directory inside your project and write ``npm install``
* Go back to root directory of your project, add a file called "packager.js"

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ file.js
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ novicell-packager (the cloned dir)
â”œâ”€â”€ packager.js
```

* In packager.js file specify the entry and save the file:
```js
module.exports = {
    entry: 'src/js/file.js'
}
```
Output is dist/ by default, however you can change it, just by adding
```js
ouput: 'dirName'
```

* Finally, run ``novicell-packager/index.js`` as a node script:
``node novicell-packager/index.js``

* Additionally, add packager to git ignore:
```
novicell-packager
packager.js
```
.gitignore
